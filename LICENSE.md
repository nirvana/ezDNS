The Truly Free License (sm)
======================
Version 1.0.0

Preamble
========

Free software should be truly free. The GPL and its derivatives infringe
upon the freedoms of the licensee by forcing forcing the
re-licensing of free software under their restrictive license.

Many advocates of the GPL are confused about their rights under
permissive licenses and consequently violate them by incorporating
free code in derivative works under viral licenses, taking away freedom.

This license is designed to prevent its subject from being re-licensed
under anti-business, anti-freedom licenses such as the GPL.

not having a million derivatives running around, sowing confusion wherever they go.
